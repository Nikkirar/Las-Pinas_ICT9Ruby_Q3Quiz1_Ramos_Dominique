     <h2> Synopsis </h2>
     <p>In 1962, journalist Chow Mo-wan and his wife move into a Hong Kong apartment, but Chow's spouse is often away on business. Before long, the lonely Chow makes the acquaintance of the alluring Su Li-zhen, whose own significant other also seems preoccupied with work. As the two friends realize their respective partners are cheating on them, they begin to fall for one another; however, neither wants to stoop to the level of the unfaithful spouses</p>
     <h2>Director</h2><p> Wong Kar-wai</p>
     <h2>Cast</h2>
<p>Maggie Cheung (Su Li-zhen - Mrs. Chan)
Tony Leung (Chow Mo-wan)
</p><h2>Review</h2> <p>Sentimental story of a couple who have been estranged from their respective marriages, starting to build up a relationship to find their lost love within each other.

Masterfully Directed and beautifully shot. Acting was pure & awesome. Both the leads were great. Maggie and Tony both delivered brilliant performances which were different & somewhat deeper than their previous roles in wong kar-wai films. 
It's well written & well paced. Loved it's poetic tone as well. 
Kudos to Wong Kar-wai for his unique & stylish storytelling. No one could've made this kinda story to screen any better.

Eames</p> <h2> Review</h2><p>You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully. It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter. It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing. It is beautiful and absorbing. It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen. I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it. That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement. That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all. For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.</p>

<h2>Review</h2>
</p><p> This movie reminds me of why I love watching movies.it has everything perfect I mean every Little thing are perfect stars from Screenplay is awesome it has every layer that I want from a movie like Blade Runner.I am a big fan of Ridley Scott's original 1982 Blade Runner its flawed masterpiece and I love the movie too.let's talk about the cinematography of Mr. Roger Deakins I love that mans vision for movies the visuals are mesmerizing and heart touching and a lot of the work, not Evan Camerawork. Mr.Deni Villeneuve directing doing such a fantastic job he is the guy who created Sicario,Prisoner,Enemy,and arrival it makes total seance that he is Great director working today and lets talk about acting of Ryan Gosling this man is getting better and better at his job his work is amazing and Harrison Ford and Robin Wright also did nice job and also Female Actress as well.The soundtrack of this move is Beautiful as hell and overall this is the best Sci-fi movie I have seen in a long time.One thing that I am very impressed about that is they didn't try too hard for making this sequel I mean they didn't try to make a 7 or 8 movie franchise they just make a great Sequel of all time.

     <h3 class="review-title">A Gentle Breeze In The Village (2007)</h3>
     <h2> Synopsis</h2>
     <p>Soyo Migata is a quirky 8th grade student who resides in a tiny rural village somewhere in Japan. The village is small enough where there‚Äôs only 6 students that attends their school. Soyo‚Äôs been friends with her classmates since early childhood and they all hang out together like an extended family. One day, a new student named Hiromi Osawa arrives. He‚Äôs a good looking boy from Tokyo and all the other students view as something of a celebrity.</p>
     <h2>Director</h2>
     <p> Nobuhiro Yamashita
     <h2>Cast</h2><p>

Kaho
(Soyo Migita)

Masaki Okada
(Hiromi Osawa)

Elisa Yanagi
(Ibuki Taura)

Sh√¥ko Fujimura
(Atsuko Yamabe)
<h2>Review</h2>
</p><p> Rarely has a title fit so perfectly the picture bearing it. Cute, corny and inoffensive, with just a pinch of salt to suggest the flavour of the old Yamashita, whose reputation lies mostly with tongue-in-cheek deadpan Jarmusch-like satires such as The Ramblers and Linda, Linda, Linda, A Gentle Breeze in the Village is a sunny countryside love story. Taking place in a peaceful little village practically untouched by the digital revolution of the big city, the plot is based on a girl's manga story by Fusako Kuramochi whose sub-adolescent readership will be the first to appreciate the film adaptation. Taking its time, throwing in a diversionary subplot here and there, Yamashita's film is first and foremost destined for matinee screenings on the home market, with very little to attract audiences elsewhere.

<h2>Review</h2>
</p><p> A blessing.This movie has done complete justice to Aciman's beautiful writings.This movie casts an unbreakable spell on anyone who watches it. The acute observations of desire and the story shot from Elio's point of view is agonizingly heartbreaking but beautiful in a very breathtaking manner. Luca has done a wonderful job as a director as it has been clearly showcased by the excellency in the quality of direction of the film . Each and every emotion of the movie was felt so deeply by the heart. The splendid sunny Northern Italian landscapes are so surreal and stare-worthy.Timothee Chalamet and Armie Hammer's performance and outstanding chemistry in this movie is one that will be remembered throughout the generations. The soundtrack and Sufjan's heavenly voice just adds up to the beauty of the movie. Greatest love stories of our time. I dont hesitate to entitle this as the best movie i have ever seen. Timothee again, has amazed me and i am so grateful that an artist like Timmy exists in my time.Love him. Love the cmbyn crew!
